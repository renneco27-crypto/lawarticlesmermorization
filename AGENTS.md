# COG: Agentic Second Brain - Universal Agent Commands

This document defines the available commands/skills for AI agents interacting with COG (Cognition + Obsidian + Git) - a self-evolving agentic second brain system.

**Compatible with:** OpenAI agents, Claude (via this file), and any AI that reads markdown.

> **Note:** Claude Code users should use `.claude/skills/` and Kiro users should use `.kiro/powers/` for native support. This file serves as universal documentation for all other agents.

## Available Commands

### /onboarding

**Description:** Personalize COG for your workflow - creates profile, interests, and watchlist files with a smart, conversational setup.

**Triggers:**
- `/onboarding`
- "onboarding"
- "setup COG"
- "setup my profile"
- "get started"

**Purpose:** Welcome new users and collect essential information to personalize their COG experience through natural conversation - not sequential form-filling. Creates profile documents stored as markdown files within the vault.

**How it works:**
1. Asks ONE open-ended question: "Tell me about yourself - name, role, and what you're interested in"
2. Intelligently parses the response to extract name, role, interests, projects, news sources, and competitive watchlist
3. Only asks a follow-up if required info (name, role, interests) is still missing
4. Asks about agent mode preference (solo vs team) during confirmation
5. Confirms extracted info before creating files
6. Matches role to a role pack (`.claude/roles/*.md`) for personalized skill and integration recommendations
7. Discovers integrations — presents role-specific recommendations, asks which tools the user already uses
8. Creates `00-inbox/MY-PROFILE.md` with role_pack, agent_mode, and preferences
9. Creates `00-inbox/MY-INTERESTS.md` with topics for daily briefs
10. Creates `00-inbox/MY-INTEGRATIONS.md` with active/disabled integrations
11. Optionally creates project structures in `04-projects/` and `03-professional/COMPETITIVE-WATCHLIST.md` (only if mentioned)
12. Generates a welcome guide with role-ordered skills and integration status

**Agent modes:**
- **Solo** (default): All skills handle everything directly in one conversation
- **Team**: Skills delegate research, analysis, and writing to specialist sub-agents for deeper results (works best with Claude Code)

**Design principle:** Never ask redundant questions. Never show numbered option menus. Infer what you can from context.

**Run this first** if you're new to COG.

**Description:** Evaluate URLs and tools — check vault coverage, assess relevance, recommend save or skip.

**Triggers:**
- `/scout`
- "scout this"
- "evaluate this"
- "should I save this?"
- "is this relevant?"

**Purpose:** Lightweight triage that sits between "ignore" and `/url-dump`. Checks existing vault coverage, assesses relevance to your profile and interests, and recommends save or skip.

**What it does:**
1. Accepts URL(s) or tool name(s)
2. Searches the entire vault for existing coverage (duplicates, mentions)
3. If new — fetches content, detects type (tool, article, repo, research, news, reference)

5. Recommends **Save** (hands off to `/url-dump` with pre-filled category) or **Skip** (explains why)
6. Supports batch mode (multiple URLs in one invocation)

**Boundary with `/url-dump`:** Scout evaluates ("should I save this?"). URL-dump saves ("save this now"). If you already know you want to save, use `/url-dump` directly.

---

### /update-cog

**Description:** Check for and apply upstream COG framework updates without touching personal content.

**Triggers:**
- `/update-cog`
- "update COG"
- "check for updates"
- "get latest COG version"
- "upgrade COG"
- "new COG version"

**Purpose:** Safely update framework files (skills, docs, scripts) from the official upstream repository while leaving all personal content untouched.

**What it does:**
1. Reads `COG-VERSION` to determine current version
2. Adds/fetches the `cog-upstream` remote from the official repo
3. Compares each framework file against upstream
4. Detects customizations and offers per-file keep/overwrite/backup
5. Applies updates via surgical `git checkout` (no merge conflicts)
6. Reports updated files and suggests committing

**Shell script alternative:**
```bash
./cog-update.sh           # Interactive
./cog-update.sh --check   # Check for updates
./cog-update.sh --dry-run # Preview changes
./cog-update.sh --force   # Update all without prompting
```

**Safety:** Content folders (`00-inbox/`, `01-daily/`, `02-personal/`, etc.) are NEVER touched. Only framework files (skills, docs, scripts) are updated.

---

### /memory-hygiene

**Description:** Periodic trust sweep of persistent memory and durable knowledge notes - re-verifies environment-dependent claims against the live environment, stamps `last_verified` + `confidence`, and proposes archiving drifted entries.

**Triggers:**
- `/memory-hygiene`
- "audit my memories"
- "check for stale memories"
- After a memory misfires (a recalled fact turned out wrong)

**Purpose:** Prevent the **stale-but-confident** failure mode: an entry that was correct when written silently drifts after the environment changes, yet still ranks high at recall and gets acted on. Makes trust a runtime decision, not a property of the stored item.

**What it does:**
1. Sweeps agent memory files and environment-referencing notes in `05-knowledge/`
2. Classifies claims: environment-dependent (verify with `ls`/`curl`/`gh`) vs preference/judgment (check only for contradiction with newer entries)
3. Stamps `last_verified` + `confidence` (high/medium/low) into each entry's frontmatter
4. Fixes verified-wrong facts in place; proposes (never auto-applies) archiving obsolete entries
5. Writes one sweep report to `01-daily/` with a drift scorecard and deltas vs the previous sweep

**Budget:** ~1 minute per entry. Unverifiable ≠ drifted.

---

### /content-factory

**Description:** Autonomous content pipeline - scout announcements in your field, triage by trend momentum and personal angle, produce posts/blogs/videos in your voice with ledger-based dedup, hard volume caps, and screenshot-verified publishing.

**Triggers:**
- `/content-factory`
- "run the content factory"
- "turn today's news into content"
- Scheduled runs (e.g. nightly via cron)

**Purpose:** Act as the user's autonomous content creator with zero duplicates, hard per-night volume caps, and verification before anything counts as published. An empty run is a valid run; a low-quality post is not.

**What it does:**
1. SCOUT — web-search + watchlist fetch for last-24h announcements (timeboxed ~20 min)
2. TRIAGE — score candidates on trend momentum, beat fit, and unique angle; produce at ≥11/15, park 8-10, ignore <8; dedup against the ledger
3. PRODUCE — format ladder decided by substance: short post by default, blog only with ≥3 original things or a real PoC, short video only if demo-able
4. PUBLISH — environment gate, then post-condition check: screenshot/curl the live artifact before recording it as published
5. LEDGER + LOG — append to `04-projects/content-factory/ledger.md` and the tonight file, even for empty runs

**Output:** Published links in the ledger; parked ideas and proposals in the run log.

---

### /auto-research

**Description:** Deep strategic research engine — decomposes questions into parallel research threads, spawns multiple agents, and synthesizes into actionable strategic analysis.

**Triggers:**
- `/auto-research`
- "research [topic]"
- "investigate [question]"
- "strategic analysis"
- "deep dive into [topic]"

**Purpose:** Take a high-level strategic question, decompose it into 5-7 parallel research threads, investigate each with real web sources, and synthesize findings into an actionable strategic analysis with scenarios and recommendations.

**What it does:**
1. Decomposes the question into independent research threads (market forces, historical precedent, player analysis, technology trajectory, emerging tech, contrarian view, etc.)
2. Presents decomposition for user approval before launching research
3. Spawns parallel research agents (team mode) or runs sequential research passes (solo mode)
4. Each thread searches 8-12 high-quality sources via web search
5. Synthesizes all threads into a unified strategic analysis with scenarios, options, and recommendations
6. Saves to vault with executive summary

**Output location:** `05-knowledge/research/YYYY-MM-DD-[slug].md`

**Key features:**
- No hallucinated sources — every claim traces to real web search results
- Emerging tech thread always included — surfaces pre-mainstream concepts
- Contrarian view section challenges consensus
- Confidence levels and gaps explicitly stated

## Worker Agents

COG includes 6 specialized worker agents (`.claude/agents/`) that handle data-heavy tasks using Sonnet while the lead session (Opus) handles reasoning and synthesis. Inspired by [garrytan/gstack](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack) specialist sessions and [garrytan/gbrain](https://github.com/garrytan/gbrain) knowledge patterns.

| Agent | What it does | When it's used |
|---|---|---|
| **worker-data-collector** | Structured extraction from GitHub, Slack, Jira, Linear, or files | Team briefs, issue audits, data gathering |
| **worker-researcher** | Web research with source citations and evidence | Auto-research threads, daily brief sourcing |
| **worker-file-ops** | Vault reads/writes, metadata, profile updates | Knowledge consolidation, profile maintenance |
| **worker-executor** | Pre-approved mutations (Jira transitions, Linear updates) | Team brief sync-back, issue management |
| **worker-publisher** | Publishing to Slack, Confluence, Notion, webhooks | Brief publishing, wiki sync |
| **brief-people-updater** | Batch-update people profiles from meetings/briefs | After team briefs, meeting processing |

**Key rule:** Workers write results to `/tmp/{task-slug}.md` and return only a short status + file path. The lead session reads the file for synthesis.

---

## People CRM

COG tracks the people you work with using progressive, evidence-based profiles stored in `05-knowledge/people/`.

**Profile structure:** Each person has a two-layer file:
1. **Compiled Truth** (top) — current best understanding, updated as evidence changes
2. **Timeline** (bottom) — append-only dated entries with source citations

**Tiered enrichment** — profiles auto-escalate:
- **Tier 3 (Stub):** 1 mention → name, role, one-line context
- **Tier 2 (Moderate):** 3+ mentions → executive snapshot, working style, strengths
- **Tier 1 (Full):** 8+ mentions or direct meeting → complete profile

**Citation format:** Every observation must include:
`[Source: [[path/to/source-note]] | YYYY-MM-DD | confidence: high|medium|low]`

Create profiles manually using the template at `06-templates/people-profile-template.md` or run the `brief-people-updater` agent for batch updates.

## Quick Start

1. **New user?** Run `/onboarding` first to set up your profile
2. **Capture thoughts?** Use `/braindump` anytime
3. **Morning routine?** Run `/daily-brief` for your intelligence briefing
4. **End of week?** Use `/weekly-checkin` to reflect
5. **Save a link?** Use `/url-dump` with the URL
6. **Evaluate a tool?** Use `/scout` to check relevance before saving
7. **Build knowledge?** Run `/knowledge-consolidation` periodically
8. **Create user stories?** Use `/create-user-story` with a problem/solution
9. **Draft a PRD?** Use `/generate-prd` with your problem context
10. **Release notes?** Use `/generate-release-notes` with a version
11. **Strategic research?** Use `/auto-research` with your question

---

## Configuration

All configuration is stored as readable markdown files:
- `00-inbox/MY-PROFILE.md` - Profile, role pack, agent mode, and active projects
- `00-inbox/MY-INTERESTS.md` - Topics for news curation
- `00-inbox/MY-INTEGRATIONS.md` - Active/disabled external service integrations
- `03-professional/COMPETITIVE-WATCHLIST.md` - Companies/people to track

Edit these files anytime - changes take effect immediately.

### Role Packs

COG matches your role to a role pack during onboarding. Role packs (in `.claude/roles/`) define:
- Which skills are most relevant for your role
- Which integrations to recommend
- Suggested agent mode (solo vs team)

Available packs: Product Manager, Engineering Lead, Engineer, Designer, Founder, Marketer. Create custom packs from `_template.md`.

## Version & Updates

COG tracks its version in `COG-VERSION` (currently 3.5.0). To check for updates:
- Run `/update-cog` in any supported agent
- Or use the shell script: `./cog-update.sh --check`
- Validate packaged agent surfaces with `./scripts/validate-agent-surface.sh`

Updates only touch framework files (skills, docs, scripts) — your personal content is never modified.

---

## Task Format

All skills generate tasks with [Obsidian Tasks emoji format](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Reference/Task+Formats/Tasks+Emoji+Format) for dashboard compatibility:

```markdown
- [ ] Action item 📅 YYYY-MM-DD
```

**Date calculation by context:**
- "Immediate (24-48 hours)" → tomorrow's date
- "Short-term (1-2 weeks)" → +1 week from today
- "Today/This Week" → today or end of week
- "Next Steps" → next Monday/Friday

This enables:
- Tasks dashboard queries ("due today", "due this week")
- Daily notes task views
- Date-based filtering and sorting

---

## Philosophy

COG follows these principles:
